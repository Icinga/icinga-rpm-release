## About

This repository provides the sources for the `icinga-rpm-release` package.

The intention is to install the package repository key and configuration files
on RHEL based systems in order to use packages.icinga.com

More information can be found inside the [Icinga 2 documentation](https://docs.icinga.com/icinga2/latest/).

## Development

Each distribution version is located in a separate branch.

In case of adding a new release e.g. `f26` branch off the previous
release including all fixes e.g. `f25` and modify the spec file.

**TODO**
* Add support for SLES
